# Identifying Key Entities in Recipe Data

## Project Description
This project focuses on identifying and extracting key entities from recipe data using natural language processing techniques. The goal is to analyze recipe texts and automatically detect important components such as ingredients, quantities, cooking methods, and tools.

## Features
- Named Entity Recognition (NER) for recipe-specific entities
- Preprocessing and normalization of recipe text
- Visualization of extracted entities
- Support for multiple recipe formats

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of CRF-based NER systems in extracting structured information from informal, domain-specific text like recipes. With carefully crafted features and domain-aware preprocessing, the model delivers high accuracy and is adaptable to other domains such as:
- Medical prescriptions
- Product catalogs
- Shopping lists
By structuring recipe data, this approach opens the door to advanced applications like personalized meal planning, automated grocery list generation, and nutritional analysis.
